    <p>Climate change effects us humans by worsening the air and water quality. 
    It Also cause certain diseases.It can cause mental issues. It can cause damages to 
    ecosystems and infrastructure. Drought can harm food production.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>More severe storms.</li>
        <li>Increased drought.</li>

    <figcaption class="center">This represents climate chnange affect </figcaption>
    <p>Climate Change can affect poverty by the next ten years.It can also make 
    people migrate to their countries by 2050.103 million can be in poverty in the next
    ten years.Environmental problems cause more suffering among the poor: â€¢ overcrowded urban areas 
    increase the risk of disease. shortages of wood for fuel and other uses make it more expensive to buy. 
    soil erosion and deforestation cause declining crop yields. While average standards of living
    has risen, The gap between the very rich and the very poor has widened.Poor people and nations suffer the effects Of
    Environmental damage more severly than the rich.</p>

        <figcaption class="center">This represents the Economy.</figcaption>
        <p>Climate change can effect the economy by Global warming will primarily influence 
        economic growth through damage to property and infrastructure, lost productivity,
        mass migration and security threats. The balance between winners and losers turns
        increasingly negative as temperatures rise.Overall, climate change will harm the U.S. 
        economy, even with modest amounts of warming. The U.S. economy would stand to lose between
        about 1 percent to 4 percent of GDP annually by the end of the century through effects to mortality, 
        labor and the energy sector alone under a high emissions scenario.New York city has led to an urban 
        heat island, which causes temperatures to be warmer overnight in all seasons.</p>

    <h1>How Can Climate Change Affect Transportation</h1>

            <h2>How can climate effect trains?</h2>
            <p>Climate Change effects Transportation by more frequent and severe heat waves may require track repairs or speed restrictions to avoid derailments. Heavy precipitation could also lead to delays and disruption, and tropical storms and hurricanes can also flood or leave debris on railways, disrupting rail travel and freight transport. </p>

            <h3>Impacts on ice roads</h3>
            <img src="ice roads.jpg" width="300px" height="200px" alt="people" class="center">
            <p>Freezing temperatures are required for ice roads in Alaska. 
            These are frozen routes used to connect northern communities, 
            as well as the oil, gas, and mining industries. The tundra beneath 
            these frozen roads is fragile, so transportation is limited to periods 
            when the ground is frozen. Warming temperatures would reduce the number
             of days when ice  roads are open, limiting transportation access to these areas.</p>
